Python for Data Science - Part 1: cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1

Twitter data sets

The Twitter-associated data sets for use with this tutorial are not stored within the github repository.  Instead, they are stored separately at the locations indicated below.

Five files are available, although you can decide which ones you want to download based on the information below.

Available files:

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1/data/twitter/climatechange_2018_11_26_17_19_15_679824.json  (size: approximately 156 MB)

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1/data/twitter/climatechange_2018_11_27_11_30_06_972631.json  (size: approximately 145 MB)

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1/data/twitter/climatechange_tweets_all.csv  (size: approximately 119 MB)

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1/data/twitter/climatechange_tweets_sample.csv  (size: approximately 14 MB)

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1/data/twitter/climatechange_tweets_fixed.csv  (size: approximately 12 MB)

Notes:

(1) The json files are needed only if you want to run the code described in the section on "Extracting and Reorganizing Twitter Data" at https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/pydatasci1/filtering_twitter and in the associated Jupyter notebook named climatechange_extract_data_from_twitter_json_example.ipynb .  If you are not interested in doing that preprocessing and only want to work with the filtered csv file used in subsequent sections, you do not need to download the json files.

(2) The small csv files climatechange_tweets_sample.csv and climatechange_tweets_fixed.csv are generated by the code contained in the notebook 
climatechange_extract_data_from_twitter_json_example.ipynb , using the json files as input.  So if you are planning to run that code, you do not need to download these smaller files -- they are included here for the sake of completeness.

(3) The large csv file climatechange_tweets_all.csv is the only dataset needed to run the code contained in the notebook named climatechange_tweet_timelines.ipynb and described in the tutorial page at https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/pydatasci1/tweets_retweets .
